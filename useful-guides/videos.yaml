    Always record your own footage and critique your own gameplay using sources like these as a reference. 
    Beware of soliciting advice on loadouts/etc. from /r/planetside as the subreddit has no filter to distinguish between good and bad players, and many upvoted comments contain terrible advice. 

    Learn from experience and from the people who can demonstrate their capabilities, like those above.

    If you have questions or need critique from vetted players that helped write all of these guides, ask in <#415955388622569492>!
