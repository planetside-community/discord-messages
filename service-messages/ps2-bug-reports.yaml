      This is a strictly moderated channel for reporting Planetside 2 bugs to Daybreak. 
      *Use this channel only for actual bug reports. Use <#251101848730075137> to discuss posted bugs.*
      If you post things in here other than bug reports, we may revoke your access to this channel.

      **When submitting a bug report:**
      1) Be as specific and detailed as possible.
      2) Provide detailed steps to reproduce the problem. Imagine that you had to take these instructions and make the bug happen again on your machine.

      For errors in the terrain or in bases, use the /loc command to get exact coordinates for where the issue is.

      This channel is not for reporting other players for doing things -- cheating, exploiting, whatever. Use the in-game report function or email `cheater@planetside2.com` for that. If you're reporting an issue that shouldn't be made public, such as reproduction steps for an exploit, use `cheater@planetside2.com` for that as well.
